# Project 4 | Viewr
## Viewr:
### The goal of Viewr was to be a forum type site where anyone could share info on songs, movies, or games that they like with links provided. Then if you wanted a quick recommendation for any category you could just pop onto said page.

## Problems with development
~ I began this project attempting to use Django and SQL as my back-end server. I also had a completely different idea at the beginning of this journey. 
~ My hand was forced by the time constraint and I had to switch to express and an idea that did not call for a relation of my three models
~ If I could do this over, I would manage my time better and make my first idea more buffed out to ensure I have a clear development path.
